## Beat The Break - [Live Site](https://beatthebreak.com)

Beat The Break is a fun music interactive game based around the famous MPC (Music Production Centre). The MPC is at the heart of most modern music productions but rose to fame in the 80's with the introduction of the Akai MPC60.

This game aims to teach the user the basic operation of a drum sequencer. They will learn how different beats/breaks are programmed across a grid of 16 pads and four differnt drums (Kick, Snare, Hi-Hat and Open Hi-Hat).

## UX

The goal of this game is to:

* Match corresponding pad when you hear the beep. If you click correctly then you will get visual feedback from the pad and the sequencer will now play the sound of the drum type you have programmed.

* Provide a fun interactive way to learn the art of drum sequencing.

* Create both an audio and visual response to users hover and click actions for an immersive experience.

* Open up the world of music production and sound sequencing.

### Surface

#### Tone/Colours

The landing screen is dark and hazy to mimic the the atmosphere of old arcade halls.

The design is stylistically retro and reminiscent of classic arcade games ie. Street Fighter

A sense of depth is created with parallax effect that reacts to the users mousemove which subtly moves dust particle images.

The main game area is bright and contrasting to the landing screen. It is like stepping in to a new world, quite like how the introduction of the MPC (Music Production Center) opened up a new world of possibilities in music production.

Neumorphism is used to add a futuristic look to the drum console and pads. This adds a softness to the drum pads which benefits the design as MPC pads are made from a rubber material.

Vibrant borders and drop shadows are used to highlight modals and separate them from the background. This also adds to the sense of depth in the game.

#### Typography

The font used is quite square in form and lends to a futuristic feel.

Fonts used are:
* [Michroma](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Michroma)

* [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins)

Font is linked from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) in the Style Sheet.

## Features

### Existing Features:

#### Landing Screen:
   - The landing screen is simple in form and has a subltle parallax animaiton based on the users mouse move.
   - An audio track plays in the background and the boombox image is animated to the beat of the music.
   - The landing screen is simple in form and has a subltle parallax animaiton based on the users mouse move.

#### Navigation:
   - Navigation is provided via two buttons on the landing screen, "How to Play" and "Start Game". Further navigation is provided within the modals that these buttons activate.

#### Modals:
   - Modals are used throughout the game to display various elements e.g. "How To Play", "Select Difficulty", "You Win" & "You Lose". This prevents any need for further pages.
   - The select difficulty modal has three options, easy, normal and hard. Hover animations are used and text changes within the button for each to inform the user on how many shots they have to pass the game.
   - The "You Lose" modal gives the user the option to try again or exit to the home/landing screen. A spotify playlist is also embedded in an iFrame within. This playlist contains songs that influenced the beat patterns used in the game.
   - The "You Win" modal gives the user the option to start the game again or exit to the home/landing screen. The same Spotify playlist is also included in this modal.
   - The "How To Play" modal is made up of a carousel 

#### Animations:
   - Animations are used throughout to enhance the user experience and prompt the user if an action is needed.
   - The landing screen has a mousemove parallax animaiton to create depth and atmosphere.
   - The game title on the landing screen hovers on the y-axis giving life to the logo.
   - The boombox image is animated to the beat of the music that plays in the background making the landing screen more immersive and less static.
   - In the main game area a vinyl record spins and record needle arm animates to mimic the playing of the record. This animation is activated when the user hits play on the drum console.
   - The drum console play button animates with a scale effect to prompt the user to hit play when ready.

#### Buttons:
   - Main navigation buttons are designed to resemble the famous plastic arcade buttons.
   - When hovered the main navigation buttons play a sound and another when clicked, enhancing the interactive experience of the game.

#### Sounds:
   - The game is based around a music production instrument therefore audio is imperative.
   - Sounds similar to ones used in 80's arcade games are used to evoke a sense of nostalgia.
   - A sound sprite is used to contain all audio sounds in one single audio file. This fixes issues with playback on ios devices.

#### Drum Patterns:
   - A list of 20 drum patterns are housed withing a JSON file. Each contain a key and value. Each drum, of which there are four (Kinc, Snare, hihat, Open Hi- hat) has a value of 16 digits.
   - These digits are either 1 or 0. These 16 numbers represent the 16 pads.
   - The number 1 represents active and zero is inactive. The pad receives a class if it has the number one and plays a sound. No sound is played if the pad is zero as no class is added. This is how the drum patterns are programmed for each drum.

#### Game Console:
   - The game console in the main game area contains all gameplay feedback i.e. score, level, active drum, 16 sequencer pads, transport buttons and how to play button.

#### Sequencer Pads:
   - The sequencer pads are laid out in a 4x4 grid pattern to resemble a 16 note sequencer.
   - These pads are looped through with a blinking/pulse animation showing the user what pad is currently active.
   - Game play is based around these 16 pads and they form the main interactive element of the game.
   - When clicked, their style and colour change. If the user selects the correct pad it turns green or red if incorrect.

#### Shot Counter:
   - A shot counter is displayed on the drum console. This informs the user on how many shots/clicks they have remainig. The score decreases by 1 selects an incorrect pad.
   - When the shot counter reaches 0, the "You Lose" modal is diaplayed giving the user the option to check out the spotify playlist, try again or exit.

#### Level Display:
   - A level counter is displayed on the drum console letting the player know what level they are on.
   - When the player finishes level three the "You Win" modal is diaplayed giving the user the option to check out the spotify playlist, play again or exit.

### Features Left to Implement
* A feature I would like to implement is a free play mode allowing the player to use the drum sequencer and program their own beats.
* I would also like to add an option to change the drum sounds.
* I would like to add volume controls to set the volume for gameplay.

### User Story Testing

* "As a user I want to be engaged by the landing screen."
  * Landing screen is complete with audio and animations that set the atmosphere and tone for the game.

* "As a user I want to understand the game before I play."
  * "How To Play" button is centered on screen and coloured individually to stand out. A how to play modal is Displayed when clicked.

* "As a user I want easy navigation from launch screen to gameplay."
  * "Start Game" button is positioned in the middle of the screen and is vibrantly coloured to be easily accesible.

* "As a user I want a fun sensory game with both audio and image feedback."
  * Sound is used throughout for feedback. buttons when hovered play sounds. Incorrect pads when clicked play an error sound.
  * Images and elements are animated. Buttons respond visually to clicks and pads change colour for correct and incorrect feedback.

* "As a user I want a game that is not too difficult but increases in difficulty as I progress."
  * The sounds build up over time as you program the drum sequencer which slowy increases the difficulty in identifying the beep sound.

* "As a user I would like the option to make the game more challenging."
  * Three levels of difficulty are available to choose from: Easy, Normal and Hard.

* "As a user I would like the game test my concentration."
  * The user must pay attention to both sound an imagery and respond. This tests both the users visual and aural response.

* "As a user I want know my current score."
  * The score/shot counter is located on the drum console and styled to stand out from the rest of the console.
  * The score/shot counter updates immediately when the user selects an incorrect pad.

* "As a user I want to be aware of the level I am on."
  * The level display is positioned next to the score/shot counter and level number highlighted in red.
  * In addition, when the user completes the current level, a level modal is displayed and announces the next level.

* "As a user I want to be able to pause the game from the main game area without losing my progress."
  * The play button changes to a pause button when the game is active. This allows the user to pause the sequencer and all sounds. This button reverts back to a play button which will resume game-play when clicked.

* "As a user I want to be able to reset the game if necessary without the need to exit to the home screen to start over."
  * If the user loses all their shots a "Try Again" modal is displayed where the user has the option to reset the game and try again or exit to the main screen.
  * If the user wins, a "You Win" modal is displayed giving the user the option to play again or exit to the main screen.

* "As a user I want to be able to see the game instructions from withing the main game area."
  * A how to play button is located on the drum console in the main game area. When clicked, the "How To Play" modal is displayed.      

* "As a user I want to be able to exit the game from the main game area without using the back button."
  * A home button is located on the drum console in the main game area. This exits the game when clicked and brings the user to the landing screen.

### Manual Testing

Manual testing was completed at various stages throughout development. This ensured all elements responded correctly to each interaction as intended and functions ouput the correct result.

#### Audio

1.  ##### Issue
  * Audio was loaded and called using the < audio > html element. However after deploying the site to github pages and viewing on mobile there was an issue with playback.
1.  ##### Fix
  * Android devices handled the playback of the drum sounds in the sequencer without any issues but Apple devices would only play one sound every revolution of the sequencer.
  * In order to fix this issue I used the Howler.js audio library which handles audio much better and is much more reliable across all platforms.

2.  ##### Issue
  * Separate audio files caused lag due to the individual file sizes.
2.  ##### Fix
  * I created a single audio file to house all the sounds used in the game. Howler.js allows you to create audio sprites within a single audio file which are accessed by their position in milliseconds.
  * Using the audio sprites prevented lagging issues and responded much quicker to user interactions.

3.  ##### Issue
* Title music loop continued to play when drum sequencer was active.
3.  ##### Fix
  * Howlers global stop function was used on the start game button to stop the title music from playing.
  * This however cut the sound off and felt quite abrupt so I added a fading title music sound sprite to be played immediately after the global stop function. This allowed for a smoother transition in sound.

4.  ##### Issue
  * Audio sprite was getting cut off before finishing when exiting the game. The location.reload function stopped all processes when called thus stopping all audio from playing.
4.  ##### Fix
  * I added a setTimeout function to delay the location.reload by 500 milliseconds giving the exit sound time to play in full. This made the transition from the main game to the landing screen less abrupt.

4.  ##### Issue
  * Click functions were added to the how to play and start game buttons which paused the bombox animationa and faded the title music. The animation was reactivated and title music was played again when the "X" close button or ready buttons were clicked. This caused an issue in the main game when the how to play modal was activated as the title music began to play when dismissed which interrupted the game.
4.  ##### Fix
  * A condition was added to the function that plays the title music when the modals are dismissed. This only allowed the title music to be played when the landing scren was activated. 

#### Game Functionality

1.  ##### Issue
  * Vinyl arm and spinning record animations interfered with the playback of the drum sequencer and caused the blinking light animation that loops over each pad to lag.
1.  ##### Fix
  * The animation was reversed from playing when the play button was clicked to playng when the main game area is displayed and stopping when the play button is clicked.

2.  ##### Issue
  * When the "You Win" and "You Lose" modals were displayed the user could click outside to dismiss the modal. This allowed the game to play beyond the end level and into minus points making the game never ending.
2.  ##### Fix
  * A data-backdrop="static" attribute was applied to each modal to prevent the user from dismissing the modal. This forces the user to reset the game by chosing "Play Again" or "Try Again" buttons or exit the game.

3.  ##### Issue
  * When testing with family and friends I found that they ignored the play button which is necessary to start the sequencer. Instead they clicked the pads first which confused the game-play.
3.  ##### Fix
  * I added a scale animation to the play button to draw the users attention.
  * I dropped the opacity of the drum pads making them look disabled.
  * A pointer event of none was also applied to the drum pads which prevented the user from clicking the pads and running down their shot counter before the game began.

4.  ##### Issue
  * The pads advance when the number of correct click are equal to the number of pads in the pattern. However, the user could continue to click one correct pad which would increment the variable used to check the number of correct click by 1. This caused a nuber of issues: the pads advanced before all correct pads were selected causing the beep to play in the position of the previous and current drum type.
  * The user could also accidentally double click an incorrect pad and lose two shots.

4.  ##### Fix
  * A class was created with the pointer event of none which was added to each pad when clicked. This disabled the pads fom further clicks. This class was then removed when the user reaches a new level or resets the game.

#### Game Play

1.  ##### Issue
  * When testing with family and friends I found that they ignored the play button which is necessary to start the sequencer. Instead they clicked the pads first which caused confused.
1.  ##### Fix
  * I added a scale animation to the play button to draw the users attention.
  * I dropped the opacity of the drum pads making them look disabled.
  * A pointer event of none was also applied to the drum pads which prevented the user from clicking the pads and running down their shot counter before the game began.

2.  ##### Issue
  * When testing with family and friends I noticed that they found it difficult to keep up with the speed of the game.
  
2.  ##### Fix
  * A variable was created to store a tempo value which was set for each difficulty. The tempo now differs for each difficulty making the easy mode much slower alowing for a much more enjoyable experience for unfamiliar users. Users are now more engaged at the easier difficulty and gives them the confidence to try the harder difficulties.
