## Beat The Break - [Live Site](https://beatthebreak.com)

Beat The Break is a fun music interactive game based around the famous MPC (Music Production Centre). The MPC is at the heart of most modern music productions but rose to fame in the 80's with the introduction of the Akai MPC60.

This game aims to teach the user the basic operation of a drum sequencer. They will learn how different beats/breaks are programmed across a grid of 16 pads and four differnt drums (Kick, Snare, Hi-Hat and Open Hi-Hat).

## UX

The goal of this game is to:

* Match corresponding pad when you hear the beep. If you click correctly then you will get visual feedback from the pad and the sequencer will now play the sound of the drum type you have programmed.

* Provide a fun interactive way to learn the art of drum sequencing.

* Create both an audio and visual response to users hover and click actions for an immersive experience.

* Open up the world of music production and sound sequencing.

### Surface

#### Tone/Colours

The landing screen is dark and hazy to mimic the the atmosphere of old arcade halls.

The design is stylistically retro and reminiscent of classic arcade games ie. Street Fighter

A sense of depth is created with parallax effect that reacts to the users mousemove which subtly moves dust particle images.

The main game area is bright and contrasting to the landing screen. It is like stepping in to a new world, quite like how the introduction of the MPC (Music Production Center) opened up a new world of possibilities in music production.

Neumorphism is used to add a futuristic look to the drum console and pads. This adds a softness to the drum pads which benefits the design as MPC pads are made from a rubber material.

Vibrant borders and drop shadows are used to highlight modals and separate them from the background. This also adds to the sense of depth in the game.

#### Typography

The font used is quite square in form and lends to a futuristic feel.

Fonts used are:
* [Michroma](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Michroma)

* [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins)

Fonts are linked from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) in the Style Sheet.

#### Audio

The audio for the game is heavily based around the 80's era arcade game sounds.

The game title music was produced in Ableton Live and is based on the late 80's hip hop, sample heavy sound.

## Features

### Existing Features:

#### Landing Screen:
   - The landing screen is simple in form and has a subltle parallax animaiton based on the users mouse move.
   - An audio track plays in the background and the boombox image is animated to the beat of the music.
   - The landing screen is simple in form and has a subltle parallax animaiton based on the users mouse move.

#### Navigation:
   - Navigation is provided via two buttons on the landing screen, "How to Play" and "Start Game". Further navigation is provided within the modals that these buttons activate.

#### Modals:
   - Modals are used throughout the game to display various elements e.g. "How To Play", "Select Difficulty", "You Win" & "You Lose". This prevents any need for further pages.
   - The select difficulty modal has three options, easy, normal and hard. Hover animations are used and text changes within the button for each to inform the user on how many shots they have to pass the game.
   - The "You Lose" modal gives the user the option to try again or exit to the home/landing screen. A spotify playlist is also embedded in an iFrame within. This playlist contains songs that influenced the beat patterns used in the game.
   - The "You Win" modal gives the user the option to start the game again or exit to the home/landing screen. The same Spotify playlist is also included in this modal.
   - The "How To Play" modal contains all necessary information to play the game. Information on each difficulty setting is also included.
   - A level modal is inluded which is displayed when the user passes the level. This modal announces the next level and then fades.

#### Animations:
   - Animations are used throughout to enhance the user experience and prompt the user if an action is needed.
   - The landing screen has a mousemove parallax animaiton to create depth and atmosphere.
   - The game title on the landing screen hovers on the y-axis giving life to the logo.
   - The boombox image is animated to the beat of the music that plays in the background making the landing screen more immersive and less static.
   - In the main game area a vinyl record spins and record needle arm animates to mimic the playing of the record. This animation is activated when the user hits play on the drum console.
   - The drum console play button animates with a scale effect to prompt the user to hit play when ready.

#### Buttons:
   - Main navigation buttons are designed to resemble the famous plastic arcade buttons.
   - When hovered the main navigation buttons play a sound and another when clicked, enhancing the interactive experience of the game.

#### Sounds:
   - The game is based around a music production instrument therefore audio is imperative.
   - Sounds similar to ones used in 80's arcade games are used to evoke a sense of nostalgia.
   - A sound sprite is used to contain all audio sounds in one single audio file. This fixes issues with playback on ios devices.

#### Drum Patterns:
   - A list of 20 drum patterns are housed withing a JSON file. Each contain a key and value. Each drum, of which there are four (Kinc, Snare, hihat, Open Hi- hat) has a value of 16 digits.
   - These digits are either 1 or 0. These 16 numbers represent the 16 pads.
   - The number 1 represents active and zero is inactive. The pad receives a class if it has the number one and plays a sound. No sound is played if the pad is zero as no class is added. This is how the drum patterns are programmed for each drum.

#### Game Console:
   - The game console in the main game area contains all gameplay feedback i.e. score, level, active drum, 16 sequencer pads, transport buttons and how to play button.

#### Sequencer Pads:
   - The sequencer pads are laid out in a 4x4 grid pattern to resemble a 16 note sequencer.
   - These pads are looped through with a blinking/pulse animation showing the user what pad is currently active.
   - Game play is based around these 16 pads and they form the main interactive element of the game.
   - When clicked, their style and colour change. If the user selects the correct pad it turns green or red if incorrect.

#### Shot Counter:
   - The word "shot" as opposed to "points" is used as traditionally sounds loaded into MPC pads are referred to as "one shots".
   - A shot counter is displayed on the drum console. This informs the user on how many shots/clicks they have remainig. The score decreases by 1 selects an incorrect pad.
   - When the shot counter reaches 0, the "You Lose" modal is diaplayed giving the user the option to check out the spotify playlist, try again or exit.

#### Level Display:
   - A level counter is displayed on the drum console letting the player know what level they are on.
   - When the player finishes level three the "You Win" modal is diaplayed giving the user the option to check out the spotify playlist, play again or exit.

### Features Left to Implement
* A feature I would like to implement is a free play mode allowing the player to use the drum sequencer and program their own beats and change the drum sounds.
* I would like to add volume controls to set the volume for gameplay.
* I would like to add more drum patterns to the current JSON list of 20 drum patterns.
